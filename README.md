# Robotic-Dog
To make a robot dog which responds to sound.
## Motivation
During the pandemic situation a lot of people are under stress. Pets can be great stressrelievers but some people do not have the time/ money to take care of one. So, an artificial pet that responds to humans can be a great way to solve this problem. Our project is a small step in this direction.
## Work Summary
This robot dog was made with collective effort. The team focussed on different goals every week. Week 1 was mainly focussed on coming up with ideas on implementation and assimilation of the different hardware components and learning about them. Week 2 was spent mainly on finalising on the design of the models and implementing the same using modelling software like Blender and FreeCAD. A major time of week 2 was also spent on arranging the different components and connecting them. Week 3 was spent on coding and allowing for different movements by the dog based on different stimuli. The 3D models were also perfected that week. The final week was spent in ensuring that the code runs smoothly and the circuit components synchronize well with the cardboard model (substitutefor the designed models due to lack of 3D printing facilities).

## Conclusions
Making a robot dog isnâ€™t as complicated as it seems to be. It was a very fun experience and an opportunity to learn new technologies. We learnt many things from our team members and our professors and got to work on soft skills such as teamwork and public speaking. Overall, it was a fulfilling experience for everyone.
